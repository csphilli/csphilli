## Hi! üëã - Thanks for dropping by!
My name is Christopher (Chris is perfectly fine). I'm a full stack developer. I come from a financial background. After a pretty hefty life changing event, I decided that another change was necessary and I jumped into programming. And I never looked back. Passionate is a good word to describe it. But I like insatiable even more. I'm always on the look out for something fun to work on.

You know LinkedIn, but my YouTube channel has content that I've created in order to help fellow students improve their odds at passing School 42 exam questions

## üêù Hive projects
Most of the [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/en/) ([school 42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school))) projects I did are public. The ones I'm most proud of are pinned below this About section

## üî≠ Current project
**NOTE:** Unfortunately I can't provide public access to this repo. However, if you'd like to pick my mind about the site, and what I've done with it, i'd be glad to schedule a meeting so I can share a screen and show you.

I love baseball. When I moved to Finland, I couldn't believe they had American baseball. I joined the Helsinki Mets and played for several years. I'm now the current treasurer and website maintainer for the organization. When I first started maintaining the site, it was wordpress. But then I changed careers into computer programming and saw a great opportunity to improve my skills as a web developer.

The first thing I did was get the site off Wordpress. Not a fan at all. I was preparing for an interview with a company that utilized Vue for the frontend so I decided to port the website to Netlify and use Vue.

The big problem though, was that most of the data such as stats, field locations, schedules, etc, were all hard coded. Which meant that the only person that was ever going to maintain the site was me!

### Helsinki Mets 2.0
Now that I have some serious (well, moreso than I did then) experience with Go, Vue, Typescript, databases, Docker, etc, I decided it was time to upgrade the site.

A good developer is able to identify problems and write an application that solves those problems. The Mets site wasn't short of those. My MVP is simple:

- First and foremost, I needed to develop a barebones CMS so that someone else without programming experience could use their own credentials and change information on the site. I didn't want to use 3rd party platforms because A) It had to be free B) I wanted the additional expience developing
- The MVP CMS had to allow the following:
  - Add/edit posts.
  - Add/edit members including ability to invite members to join. I didn't want to allow any Tom, Dick, or Henry to join.
  - Add/edit field locations.
  - Members could have different roles which afforded them different rights on the site. Ability to edit those as well.
  - Ability for the contact form on the homepage to send the message to existing board members.
  - Good documentation. A FAQ specifically created for members to refer back to if they didn't know how to use the CMS
